# The Eagle and the Fox
A collaborative Scratch project made alongside Daniel Holcomb, made in late 2012 that depicts the classic Aesop fable in basic animation.

This program contains very bright and flashing colors that may not be suitable to those who succumb to seizures. Viewer descretion is advised.

This was my first group programming project. I can recall that Daniel was responsible for making the Star Wars arrangement for the credits, alongside the bright and colorful strobe show.

Scratch is required to use.
